          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            MuseMotion creates an immersive mixed reality system that generates dance moves from music and displays these moves as a virtual character in real time as one or more users play a piece. The application can be used either in solo mode or two-player mode. In solo mode, the user selects a solo piece to play on a MIDI instrument connected to their device. As they play, the user will see the character dance in real time to the music through their headset. In two-player mode, either of the users can select the piece to play from a list, and one of them chooses to be the leader. The leader plays through a MIDI device for the system to follow and generate dance moves from, while the follower can play on any instrument. This immersive experience aims to enhance musical expression and creativity by allowing users to see their music come to life in a captivating way.
